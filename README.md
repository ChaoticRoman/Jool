# Jool's website

This branch contains the source files of Jool's site and documentation.

Github automatically compiles this, and it's available at https://nicmx.github.io/Jool. Unfortunately, Github is not yet available from IPv6, so a slightly less often updated fallback exists at https://www.jool.mx.

You can compile the documentation yourself by running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) right here.

```bash
$ jekyll build
```

Have a look at your generated files in the new `_site/` folder (Start at `index.html`).
