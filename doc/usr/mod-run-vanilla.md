## Introduction

This document explains how to run Jool in [SIIT mode](intro-nat64.html#siit-traditional). Follow the link for more details on what to expect.

Software-wise, only a [successful install of Joolâ€™s kernel module](mod-install.html) is required. The userspace application is out of the scope of this document on purpose.

In case you're wondering, you can follow along these tutorials using virtual machines or alternate interface types just fine (Jool is not married to physical "_ethX_" interfaces).

## Sample Network

You don't need all the nodes shown in the diagram to follow along; you can get away with only _A_, _T_ and _V_; the rest are very similar to _A_ and _V_ and are shown for illustrative purposes only.

![Figure 1 - Sample Network](images/network/vanilla.svg)

We will pretend I have address block 198.51.100.8/21 to distribute among my IPv6 nodes. I will also pretend _E_ conveniently does not need IPv4 connectivity for some reason (just to show you that you can leave nodes out of the equation to economize IPv4 addresses).

Jool requires _T_ to be Linux. The rest can be anything you want, so long as it implements the network protocol it's connected to. Also, you are free to configure the networks using any manager you want.

For the sake of simplicity however, the examples below assume every node is Linux and everything is being configured statically using the well-known `ip` command (and friends). Depending on your distro, your mileage might vary on how to get the network manager out of the way (assuming that's what you want). Just to clarify, the point of `service network-manager stop` is to claim control over your interface addresses and routes (otherwise the `ip` commands might be ineffectual).

Also to simplify, routing will be reduced to default all unknown traffic towards _T_. Note that there is nothing martian about anyone's configuration otherwise.

This is nodes _A_ through _E_:

{% highlight bash %}
user@A:~# service network-manager stop
user@A:~# /sbin/ip link set eth0 up
user@A:~# # Replace ".8" depending on which node you're on.
user@A:~# /sbin/ip addr add 2001:db8::198.51.100.8/120 dev eth0
user@A:~# /sbin/ip route add default via 2001:db8::198.51.100.1
{% endhighlight %}

Nodes _V_ through _Z_:

{% highlight bash %}
user@V:~# service network-manager stop
user@V:~# /sbin/ip link set eth0 up
user@V:~# # Replace ".16" depending on which node you're on.
user@V:~# /sbin/ip addr add 192.0.2.16/24 dev eth0
user@V:~# /sbin/ip route add default via 192.0.2.1
{% endhighlight %}

Node _T_:

{% highlight bash %}
user@T:~# service network-manager stop
user@T:~# 
user@T:~# /sbin/ip link set eth0 up
user@T:~# /sbin/ip addr add 2001:db8::198.51.100.1/120 dev eth0
user@T:~# 
user@T:~# /sbin/ip link set eth1 up
user@T:~# /sbin/ip addr add 192.0.2.1/24 dev eth1
user@T:~# 
user@T:~# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
user@T:~# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
{% endhighlight %}

Because we haven't turned _T_ into a translator yet, nodes _A_ through _E_ still cannot interact with _V_ through _Z_, but you might want to make sure _T_ can ping everyone before continuing.

The only caveat you need to keep in mind before inserting Jool (or dealing with IPv6 in general) is that enabling forwarding in Linux does **not** automatically get you rid of offloads. Offloading is a _leaf_ node feature, otherwise a bug, and therefore it's important to turn it off on all routers. [Read this document](misc-offloading.html) if you want details.

Do that by means of `ethtool`:

{% highlight bash %}
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth0 tso off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth0 ufo off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth0 gso off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth0 gro off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth0 lro off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth1 tso off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth1 ufo off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth1 gso off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth1 gro off
user@T:~# ethtool --offload eth1 lro off
{% endhighlight %}

(If it complains it cannot change something, keep in mind it can already be off; run `sudo ethtool --show-offload [interface]` to figure it out.)

## Jool

This is the insertion syntax:

{% highlight bash %}
user@T:~# /sbin/modprobe jool_siit \
	pool6=<IPv6 prefix> \
	pool4=<IPv4 prefixes> \
	errorAddresses=<IPv4 prefixes>
{% endhighlight %}

These are the arguments:

- `pool6` (short for "IPv6 pool") is the prefix the translation mechanism will be appending and removing from the addresses of the packets.
- `pool4` (short for "[main] IPv4 pool") represents the addresses Jool will use to mask the IPv6 nodes. In other words, if an IPv6 node's address minus the NAT64 prefix does not match an entry in this pool, its traffic will not be translated.  
Because there is no port sharing, in SIIT you need as many of these as IPv6 nodes which need IPv4 connectivity.  
You can insert up to five comma-separated `pool4` prefixes during a modprobe. If you need more, use the [userspace application](usr-flags-pool4.html).  
- `errorAddresses` is a secondary IPv4 pool used for something [slightly more cryptic](misc-rfc6791.html). You might rather want to read its explanation _after_ you've nailed the basics from this walkthrough.  
You can insert up to five comma-separated `errorAddresses` prefixes during a modprobe. If you need more, use the [userspace application](usr-flags-error-addresses.html).

In our sample network, that translates into

{% highlight bash %}
user@T:~# /sbin/modprobe jool_siit \
	pool6=2001:db8::/96 \
	pool4=198.51.100.8/30,192.0.2.0/24 \ 
	errorAddresses=198.51.100.12/30
{% endhighlight %}

These are the mappings that `modprobe` generates:

- IPv6 nodes:
	- 2001:db8::<span class="correlate1">198.51.100.8</span> will be masked as <span class="correlate1">198.51.100.8</span>.
	- 2001:db8::<span class="correlate2">198.51.100.9</span> will be masked as <span class="correlate2">198.51.100.9</span>.
	- 2001:db8::<span class="correlate1">198.51.100.10</span> will be masked as <span class="correlate1">198.51.100.10</span>.
	- 2001:db8::<span class="correlate2">198.51.100.11</span> will be masked as <span class="correlate2">198.51.100.11</span>.
	- 198.51.100.12 is outside of 198.51.100.8/30, so _E_ has been left out of the NATting.
- IPv4 nodes:
	- Any IPv4 node will be masked by prepending the `pool6` prefix to its address (pool4 does not affect these).

See below for more explicit examples.

## Testing

If something doesn't work, try the [FAQ](misc-faq.html).

Try to ping _A_ from _V_ like this:

{% highlight bash %}
user@V:~$ ping 198.51.100.8
PING 198.51.100.8 (198.51.100.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 198.51.100.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=7.45 ms
64 bytes from 198.51.100.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=1.64 ms
64 bytes from 198.51.100.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=4.22 ms
64 bytes from 198.51.100.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=2.32 ms
^C

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.649/3.914/7.450/2.249 ms
{% endhighlight %}

Then ping _V_ from _A_:

{% highlight bash %}
user@A:~$ ping6 2001:db8::192.0.2.16
PING 2001:db8::192.0.2.16(2001:db8::c000:210) 56 data bytes

64 bytes from 2001:db8::c000:210: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=2.63 ms
^C
--- 2001:db8::192.0.2.16 ping statistics ---

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.384/4.529/10.522/3.546 ms
{% endhighlight %}

How about hooking up a server in _X_ and access it from _D_:

Then maybe another one in _C_ and request from _W_:

## Stopping Jool

To shut down Jool, revert the modprobe using the `-r` flag:

{% highlight bash %}
user@T:~# /sbin/modprobe -r jool_siit
{% endhighlight %}
