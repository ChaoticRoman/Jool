# Quirks

These are documents regarding Jool's design.

The Linux kernel is not much of a welcoming environment for a technology such as NAT64, so we had to make a number of decisions which might prove controversial. I will leave my arguments here. If you see something that we don't, please let us know (via <a href="https://github.com/NICMx/NAT64/issues" target="_blank">tracker</a> or [mail](mailto:jool@nic.mx)) so we (or you) can improve the code.

1. [Jool's thievish nature](quirk-thieve.html).
2. [The relationship with iptables](quirk-iptables.html).
