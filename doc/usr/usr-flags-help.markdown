## Description

Prints mostly a summary of the [userspace app flags documentation](usr-flags.html), though you can also use it to review the abbreviated form of the flags, which aren't there.

`--help` is the only mode which does not require Jool's kernel module to be active.

You might also be interested in `man jool`, which prints a better summary of the grammar.

## Syntax

	jool --help
