jool_compile_test.sh will try to compile both jool and jool_siit against all the Linux kernels versions 
officially released except 2.x versions (we officially don't support them). 

In order to run this script, you need to have installed git and configured with your credentials, as 
this script will attempt to clone the torvalds/linux repository located at https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git.

jool_compile.sh must receive as a parameter the directory where you have, or wish to have the Linux
git repository cloned (the script will create the directory and clone the repository if it doesn't exist).

PLEASE NOTE: This version of the script has not been tested (due to architectural restrictions, I can't
actually perform the pull/clone in my Linux VM (internet connection is not open), so I'm just assuming
this works based on my limited bash scripting skills).
