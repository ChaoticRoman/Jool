Some shortcuts used while naming variables and functions through the code:

nf = Netfilter (http://www.netfilter.org/)
nl = Netlink (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink)
alloc = memory allocation
pref = prefix
err = error
def = default
hdr = header
src = source
dst = destination
frag = fragment
len = length
ptr = pointer
in = incoming (Note, not "inner")
out = outgoing (Not "outer")
init = initialize
proto = protocol
l2 = layer 2 (link)
l3 = layer 3 (network; IPv4 or IPv6.)
l4 = layer 4 (transport; TCP, UDP. Also ICMP and ICMPv6 for convenience.)
addr = address
fn = function ("this parameter is a pointer to a function.")
comm = common
mod = module
usr = user[space]
cb = callback (synonym for "fn")
pool<n> = IPv<n> pool (pool4 = IPv4 pool)
pkt = packet
ver = verdict
skb = socket buffer (inherited from the kernel)
aux = auxiliar function
req = requirement


BTW: Except from line width, tab size and "kernel-doc" (100, 4 and doxygen, respectively), we're
making an effort to follow the kernel's code conventions:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle
So please don't freak out when you catch glimpse of those gotos :).
